    MessageBox("You have entered the Shadowlands, the southern slice of land on the Chimney ledge. The Shadowlands are are poorly lit, the fungus do not glow as well here. The inhabitants have a reputation for being strange and wary of guests.\n\nYou enter one of the small villages that cling together under the protection of the mighty Flickering Keep. The people there confirm your expectations. They are nearly rude in their efforts to avoid you, and direct you instead to the ruler of the Keep.")
