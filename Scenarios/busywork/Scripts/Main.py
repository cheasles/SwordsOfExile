    ChoiceBox("Adventurers have to do a lot more than just save the world. There are never any shortages of stray monsters, small uprisings, and other difficulties that require the violent touch of a small band of heroes.\n\nThis is one of those cases. You were contacted by the commander of the Empire city of Krizsan and asked to travel to the city of Cavala in nearby Mrrnah Hollow. A number of caravans have been attacked by bandits there.\n\nYou are to find the bandit hideout and wipe the vermin out. This may be difficult, however. Nobody has yet been able to figure out where the bandits live. You may have to do a bit of investigating first.\n\nMrrnah Hollow is only a two day\'s march from Krizsan, and you arrive there without difficulty. After resting for the night in an abandoned home at the entrance to the valley, you wake up, refreshed and ready to begin your investigation.\n\nThe town of Cavala is a day\'s march to the north. It might be a good place to begin.", eDialogPic.SCENARIO, 4, ["OK"])
